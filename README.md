## WebGL Project

## Introduction

Firstly, it is required that you access the `WebGL-Coursework.html` file and alter the path to the objects/textures loaded. You may run a local web server and access this file, objects, and textures. More information on running things locally can be found at [Three.js Documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally). There are 6 textures and 3 objects that paths are required to be altered.
